## Summary
In this project, I learned about the table and row elements. I picked it up fairly quickly, but I did struggle initally with getting the inputs to work with the rows. Once I got pointed in the right direction I found myself putting it all together fast. Although it was challenging in the beginning, I did over think this one which contributed to it being more difficult than it had to be.
